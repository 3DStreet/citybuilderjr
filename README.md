# citybuilderjr

City building demo project for A-Frame.

Features:
* Cross platform -- runs in most web browsers across devices.
* Simple to use -- Click and drag on desktop. Open it on a smartphone and use the device motion sensors. Or [plug in a VR headset](https://immersiveweb.dev/)!
* Quest controller support -- Use Meta Quest headset and controllers to make a scene
* Reusable gltf asset build system -- example to use for other projects

Credits:
* Continuation of work from: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe-2-vr-menus
* Modified from this original: https://glitch.com/~aframe-aincraft
* Inspired by: https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_interactive_voxelpainter.html
* Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. Make WebVR with HTML and Entity-Component. Works on Vive, Rift, desktop, mobile platforms.
* source assets from kaykit https://kaylousberg.itch.io/city-builder-bits
* audit.js and pipeline.js scripts using donmccurdy's gltf-transform package
* screenshot-glb script from shopify

build instructions
* (1) `node gltf-audit -i src` - create initial gltf-audit.json output
* (2) `node gltf-build -i src -o dist -u` - create optimized glb models
* (2) `node gltf-screenshots -i ./dist/ -o ./dist/ -u` - create preview images for each glb

gltf model pipeline utilities description

## gltf-audit.js
example usage:
`$ node gltf-audit -i src`
* returns json file with details about gltf or glb files in project ./src/ path
* -i is optional to specify a directory to audit

## gltf-build.js
example usage:
`$ node gltf-build -i src -o dist`
* takes input directory of assets and optimizes each including adding draco compression to an output directory
* -i and -o are required
* optional --update (or -u) will assume existence of gltf-audit.json from gltf-audit.js above, and add the newly built glb files under "dist" key
`$ node gltf-build -i src -o dist -u`

## gltf-screenshots.js
example usage
`$ node gltf-screenshots -i ./dist/ -o ./dist/`
`$ node gltf-screenshots -i ./dist/ -o ./dist/ -u`
* optional --update (or -u) will assume existence of gltf-audit.json from gltf-audit.js above, and add the newly built jpg files under "img" key

## screenshot-glb (shopify script)
example usage:
`$ screenshot-glb -i input.glb -o test.png`
* create a screenshot using the screenshot-glb script
* glb is required, doesn't work with gltf ([issue](https://github.com/Shopify/screenshot-glb/issues/98))
